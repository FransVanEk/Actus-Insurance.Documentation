# ACTUS Framework Documentation

The ACTUS Framework provides the foundational architecture for algorithmic contract types and standardized financial modeling. This section covers the core concepts, technical implementation, and system architecture.

## Framework Overview

The ACTUS Framework consists of:

### Core Components
- **[Core Concepts](core-concepts)**: Fundamental principles and architectural concepts
- **[Implementation Guide](implementation)**: Technical implementation guidelines and best practices  
- **[Regulatory Compliance](regulatory-compliance)**: Framework compliance with financial regulations

### Key Principles

#### Standardization
- **Unified Data Model**: Common structure for all financial contracts
- **Algorithmic Definition**: Deterministic calculation methods
- **Platform Independence**: Framework works across different technology stacks
- **Version Control**: Systematic versioning and backward compatibility

#### Modularity  
- **Contract Type Libraries**: Pluggable contract type implementations
- **Risk Factor Integration**: Flexible risk factor management
- **Event Processing**: Standardized contract event handling
- **Extension Points**: Framework customization capabilities

#### Transparency
- **Open Standards**: Publicly available specifications
- **Audit Trails**: Complete calculation traceability
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive technical documentation
- **Validation**: Built-in contract validation mechanisms

## Technical Architecture

### System Components
- **Contract Engine**: Core contract processing and cash flow generation
- **Risk Factor Service**: Market data and risk factor management
- **Event Processor**: Contract lifecycle event handling
- **Validation Framework**: Contract and calculation validation
- **Reporting Engine**: Output generation and formatting

### Integration Patterns
- **API First**: RESTful and GraphQL API interfaces
- **Batch Processing**: Large-scale portfolio processing capabilities
- **Real-time Processing**: Event-driven real-time calculations
- **Data Streaming**: Continuous data flow processing

## Implementation Approaches

### Enterprise Integration
- **Microservices Architecture**: Distributed service implementations
- **Container Deployment**: Docker and Kubernetes support
- **Cloud Native**: AWS, Azure, and GCP deployment patterns
- **On-Premise**: Traditional data center deployments

### Development Frameworks
- **Java Implementation**: Spring Boot and enterprise Java patterns
- **Python Integration**: Scientific computing and data analysis libraries
- **R Support**: Statistical analysis and risk modeling
- **C++/C# Performance**: High-performance computing implementations

## Standards Compliance

The ACTUS Framework supports:
- **ISO 20022**: Financial messaging standards
- **FpML**: Financial products markup language
- **XBRL**: Extensible business reporting language
- **RESTful APIs**: Modern web service standards
- **OpenAPI**: API documentation and code generation

## Professional Implementation

### For Technology Teams
- **System Architecture**: Scalable and maintainable system design
- **Performance Optimization**: High-throughput processing capabilities
- **Integration Patterns**: Enterprise system integration approaches
- **DevOps Support**: Automated testing, deployment, and monitoring

### For System Architects
- **Framework Design**: Extensible and modular architecture patterns
- **Performance Characteristics**: Scalability and throughput analysis
- **Security Considerations**: Enterprise security and compliance
- **Deployment Strategies**: Production deployment best practices
